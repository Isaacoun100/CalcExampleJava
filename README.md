# Java Calculator Example Using Swing

This project demonstrates how to create a simple calculator using **Java Swing** in **NetBeans 23**. The calculator provides basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This example serves as an educational resource for students learning how to develop GUI-based applications in Java.

## Project Creator
- **Isaac H.**

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to guide students through the process of creating a basic calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. By the end of this project, students will understand how to:

- Design a Swing interface using NetBeans' built-in GUI builder.
- Link the interface components (buttons, text fields) to corresponding Java code.
- Implement the logic for basic calculator functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
  
## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17** or higher
- **NetBeans 23** IDE
- Basic understanding of Java programming and Swing framework.

## Project Structure

The calculator example is built using the following components:

1. **JFrame**: The main window where all elements are placed.
2. **JButtons**: Buttons for numbers (0-9) and operations (+, -, *, /, =).
3. **JTextField**: A text field to display the current input and results.
4. **ActionListener**: Handles button click events to perform the calculator operations.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents division by zero and other invalid operations.
- **Simple Layout**: A straightforward design that uses a grid layout for button arrangement.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Isaacoun100/CalcExampleJava.git
